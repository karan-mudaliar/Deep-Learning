        "Weight initialization in deep learning refers to the procedure of assigning initial values to a neural network's weights, which are the tunable parameters learned during training. The manner in which these weights are initialized plays a critical role in shaping the training process and ultimately impacts the network's performance. Several weight initialization techniques have been developed to combat challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients, with the goal of establishing a solid foundation for training deep neural networks.
